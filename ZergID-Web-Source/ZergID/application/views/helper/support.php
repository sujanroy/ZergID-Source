<p class="support_heading">FAQ</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>Q:</b>   My game is not listed.</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support"><b>A:</b>   We are adding games as quickly as we can. Please request your game to be 
added by selecting “Game not listed” at the bottom of the game selection 
menu and we will get to it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><b>Q: </b>  How do I select Top Characters and Top Guilds?</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support"><b>A:</b>   You can choose up to 3 of your Characters and/or Guilds to appear on your 
profile page. You can select which of your Characters and/or Guilds will 
appear here by clicking the star next to your Characters/Guilds on your 
Character/Guild page.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b>   When I created my character or RSVPd to an event the only roles I could 
choose were Tank/Healer/DPS/Hybrid, but my game doesn’t have these 
roles, what gives?</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support"><b>A:</b>   While, tank/healer/DPS, the holy trinity of MMO’s for many years, we 
understand that many games are breaking the meta and other games have 
entirely different role structures. For character creation we added the 
“Hybrid” role to help round out “Support” characters that perform multiple 
roles. We are working on customizing character/event creation for each 
game, but we needed to start somewhere and felt that tank/healer/DPS 
captured the concept in the largest number of games.</p>

<p><b>Q: </b> How does the event system work?</p>
<p class="space_bottom_support"><b>A:</b>  Guild officers can create events for their guild and you can create events 
for your friends. Once you click on create event, you give the event a 
name, set the date and type, select who to invite and then choose the type 
of event :</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td class="support_table_left"><p style="font-size:13px;"><b>NO RSVPs NECESSARY  :</b></p></td>
        <td class="support_table_right"> This is a generic event, where you don’t need to 
            know who is showing up or what roles they 
            will play in the event.</td><br>
    </tr>
    <tr class="support_tab_row_height"></tr>
    
    <tr valign="top">
        <td class="support_table_left"><p style="font-size:13px;"><b>ALL RSVP’S ACCEPTED  :</b></p></td>
        <td class="support_table_right">This is a generic event, but one where you want 
            to get an idea of who is showing up, so you 
            them to RSVP. They will receive an in 
            system message asking them to RSVP to the 
            event. You can then visit the event page at 
            any time to see who is coming.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="support_tab_row_height"></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="support_table_left"><p  style=" font-size:13px;"><b>RSVPs APPROVED ONLY  :</b></p></td>
        <td class="support_table_right"> This is the choice to make when you are assembling a raid or group that needs a 
             specific make up.</td>
    </tr>
    
</table><br><br>
<p><b>Q:</b>   How does the RSVP Approval system work?</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support"><b>A:</b>   Users will receive an in system message asking them to RSVP. Once they 
click on it, they are asked to choose their potential roles in the event. They 
can choose one or more of the roles (Tank/Healer/DPS)</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support">Once people have RSVPd, the event leader can set up the team. The 
potential roles people have selected will be shown to the event creator</p>

<div class="space_bottom_support" align="center">
    <?= HTML::image("public/images/RSVP.JPG"); ?>
</div>

 <p class="space_bottom_support">The boxes with the check marks let the event creator know what roles the 
person would be able to play in the event.</p>

<p class="space_bottom_support">The event leader then selects one of the roles that the user has chosen and 
approves them for the event in that role.</p>
 <div class="space_bottom_support" align="center">
    <?= HTML::image("public/images/RSVP1.JPG"); ?>
 </div>
     <p class="space_bottom_support">The event leader can also select people to be an Alternate or once the 
        event is filled up, let people know there will not be room by selecting Deny.
     </p>

     <p class="space_bottom_support_2">Once someone is Approved to an event, the event will show up on their 
     ZergID calendar.

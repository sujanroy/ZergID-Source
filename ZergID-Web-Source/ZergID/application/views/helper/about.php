<p class="helper_heading1">About Us</p>
<p class="privacy_space_bottom">ZergID was developed by gamers to fill a void in the way MMO gamers were able to interact outside of
the game. If you are like us, you probably have played many MMO’s and became friendly with people in each particular game… but, then lost touch with those people after you or they moved on to a new 
game. Without having their personal information, you couldn't find them and unless you supplied your personal information to them... they couldn't find you. ZergID allows you to find these old friends and see what games they are playing now and even which servers and factions they are playing, all under the same anonymity that these games provided, so you can join them.</p>
<p><b>Some of ZergID’s features include:</b></p><br />
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- All your characters for all your games in one easy place. </p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- All your guilds on one site - No more having to sign up for different guild websites, each time you join a new guild.  </p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- Powerful scheduling tools for your guild or groups of friends to coordinate in game events. </p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- Easy to use search tools to find old gaming friends and reconnect in new games. </p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- Ability to communicate outside of a game with in game friends, without having to reveal personal information.</p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- (Coming Soon) Smartphone aps to relay your ZergID messages, so you will never miss out on an in game event just because you didn’t log in that day.</p>
<p class="terms_space_bottom2">- We are always looking for ways to make ZergID better for MMO gamers, so please e-mail any suggestions to <a href="mailto:suggestions@zergid.com"    style="color:#38CBF0;  text-decoration:  underline;">suggestions@zergid.com</a> </p>
